The purpose of this project is implementing the algorithm inorder to encrypt and decrypt the usersâ€™ inputs. 
With this algorithm, users are able to safely encode and decode their messages using a keyword based encryption technique. The keyword allows for a corresponding shift value for the cipher of the message. This adds an extra layer of protection and ensures that the cipher is both secure and complex. 

Once the user runs the program, a menu will be prompted with the options to Encrypt or Decrypt a message. After a selection is chosen, the user will be prompted to enter a keyword. Based on keyword, the encrypted or decrpyted messaged will be outputed to the user!
